This was for an assignment with the scrimba.com front end developer course. 
The assignment involved coding html, css and javascript.  The assignment used numbers instead of card images.
I spent some extra time extending the assignment by using card images instead of numbers. 
Changed background, contextual messages, card images and flow from original assignment.
